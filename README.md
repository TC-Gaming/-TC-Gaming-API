# [TC] Gaming API Documentation

**API Version:** 2  
**Latest Revision:** 16th April 2017  

Our REST API lets developers gain full access to all of the [TC] server statistics including live server statuses and CityDriving statistics.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `https://api.tc-gaming.co.uk`. All data is sent and received as JSON. The API requires an [API key](introduction/api-keys.md) to be passed as a parameter. All timestamps are returned as unix timestamps.
