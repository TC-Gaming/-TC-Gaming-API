## \[TC\] Gaming API Documentation

**API Version:** 2  
**Latest Revision:** 23rd December 2018

Our REST API lets developers gain full access to all of the \[TC\] server statistics including live server statuses and CityDriving statistics.

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `https://api.tc-gaming.co.uk`. All data is sent and received as JSON. The API requires an [API key](getting-started/readme/api-keys.md) to be passed as a parameter. All timestamps are returned as unix timestamps.
