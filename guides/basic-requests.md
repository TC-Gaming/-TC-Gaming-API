# Basic Requests

If you're new to using REST APIs, here are the basics for making your first data requests.

{% method %}
## How many players are online?

In this first example we will make a request to the [Server Status API](../citydriving-statistics-api/server-status-api.md) to work out how many players are online and present this information to our user.

{% sample lang="js" %}
Here is how to print a message to `stdout` using JavaScript.

```js
console.log('My first method');
```

{% sample lang="php" %}
Here is how to print a message to `stdout` using Go.

```php
fmt.Println("My first method")
```

{% common %}
Whatever language you are using, the result will be the same.

```bash
$ My first method
```
{% endmethod %}
